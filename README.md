# FilmQueryProject

## Description
### This program allows you to search a film database to find the film you are looking for! You can look up a film by its film ID, or you can search for a keyword from a description of the film or its title. When a film is found, its title, description, language, rating, year of release, and involved actors will be listed. You can also expand the details list for more details, including rental information.

## Technologies Used
### Java, SQL, MySQL, Maven, JDBC, search queries, atom, command line interface

## What I learned
### I learned how to code search queries using SQL into a java script, allowing for limited-feature tailored searches via user input as keywords. I also learned how to set up a connection between a local server database and a java project in order to accomplish the above mentioned task.
